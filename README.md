Welcome to my guide for snowboarding conditions! I have 2 conditions to be met. The 1st is temperature of 30Â°F.  The 2nd is whether or not there is snowfall.  If both conditions are met, you get a green light to go; if one is not conducive it will return to tell you to try another day. All you have to do is enter your location!
